% Try to build around this spider web analogy

% TODO maybe delete "and support the entire web"
Regardless of one's feelings towards spiders, one must admit that elaborate spider webs possess a certain beauty to them. In viewing mathematics as a colossal spider web, what excites me is discovering those hidden threads which are in fact as strong as steel. These hidden connections drive my mathematical interests.
 \\




% Take algebraic geometry and graph theory as examples of this spider web that are polar opposites as subjects

% from Complex analysis: Normal Families and no nonconstant entire functions ---> Bloch's principle.

% TODO Need a transition to linear storytelling

% TODO Summarize high school junior and senior year stuff

The department gave me the freedom to push myself right out of the gate taking almost an identical courseload to UVA's first-year graduate students. ...

% TODO Talk about experience of doing math with other people.

Moreover, I experienced about another awesome aspect of mathematics: collaborating (and struggling) on tough problems with people who are just as determined and passionate about math as I am. ...
% Expand on the above
% experience working with classmates, "some around my age, some 10 years older than me, it made no difference to the feeling of belonging [find better word, something like collectiveness or something]"

This upcoming semester, I will continue to push myself by again taking the standard courses for UVA's first-year graduate students: algebraic topology, measure theory, and algebra II.
\\
% TODO talk about plan to take the analysis, topology, and algebra general exams



% TODO talk about how I enjoy playing around with things.

% TODO talk about self study Tao Measure theory, Evans PDEs
